      <description>Project 2: Movie Recommendation Engine  Imported a movie dataset csv file and used sklearn and machine learning algorithms to recommend movies based off your inputed favorite. Engineered features to use in the algorithm: &amp;ldquo;overview&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;keywords&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;cast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;genres&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;director&amp;rdquo;. Combined the features into one string and used CountVectorize to convert the collection of text to token counts Used the Cosine Similarity to create a matrix showing the similar movies based off the features combined Created a function to be able to look through then index of movies to return a movie title that matches the similarity index.</description>

      <description>Project 3: NCAA: Which Mascot Wins More? Python/SQL  For this project I asked the question of: &amp;ldquo;Does a college basketball team perform better when their mascot is Human or Non-Human in the NCAA basketball Tournament?&amp;rdquo; This report will take the results from every NCAA Tournamnet game since the 1985 season and compare whether teams with Non-Human or Human mascots win more. I first came across the data I needed on Kaggle.</description>

      <description>Project 4: Vacation Website  This is my website project I built of my trip I took to Iceland. It is more like a travel blog/photo gallery. This is the basic write up for it with more refined and update photo gallerys to come. I incorporated HTML language to build the infustructure of the website and linked CSS elments to stylize the website. Used Javascript to prompt displays when clicking the logo as well as to display the picture slideshow.</description>
